The iris dataset originated from research carried out by Edgar Anderson (American botanist) in 1935, whom collected three species of the iris flower with a goal to quantify the morphological variation.  In 1936 Ronald Fisher adapted this data published a paper “maximize the ratio of the difference between the specific means to the standard deviation within species”.  adapted Anderson data to determine if linear regression could be used/applied
