The iris dataset originated from research carried out by Edgar Anderson (American botanist) in 1935, whom collected three species of the iris flower with a goal to quantify the morphological variation.

 The iris dataset originated from research carried out by Edgar Anderson (American botanist) in 1935, whom collected three species of the iris flower with a goal to quantify the morphological variation. Two of the three species were collected in the  Gaspé Peninsula ”The irises of the Gaspé Peninsula".

Ronald Fisher adapted Anderson data to determine if linear regression could be used/applied . In 1936 Fisher published a paper “maximize the ratio of the difference between the specific means to the standard deviation within species”.  [2;1]  It is important to understand that Fisher focused on the linear discrimination analysis. The Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis.[1]

 ## Data Set:
 
 <img src="https://sudaniscience.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/9.png?w=720 " width="800" title="Iris flower species"> 
 
Is dataset is multivariate which involves analysis of two or more variables


The data set consists of:

- Data size: 150 random observations
- Data distribution: 50 entries for each class
- There is no missing data
- Iris dataset is classified into 5 variables
- Flower species- Categorical data can be divided into 3 classes

             - Iris setosa

             - Iris virginica 

              - Iris versicolor


- 4 numeric features measure in cm

            - Petal width in cm 

            - Petal length in cm 

            - Sepal width in cm 

            - Sepal length in cm 


Image below depicts the difference between the petal and sepal.  Sepal is defined as the outermost structure of the flower, that  surround the more fragile parts of the flower .e.g. petals. Typically the petals can be  distinguished as being small and green  and the petals are colorful. However, this is not applicable to the iris flower species. Note in this image of the Iris Virginica  the sepals are larger than the petals  and are drooping, while the petals are upright.​

Based on the combination of the four numeric features, the classification of the iris flower is made.  
One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.
